2. **Login Page**: Users can access the app by entering their mobile number and password on the secure Login Page.

3. **Registration Page**: A Registration Page is available for users who want to create a new account, making it easy for newcomers to sign up and start ordering.

4. **Forgot Password Page**: In case users forget their password, the app includes a Forgot Password Page that facilitates password reset.

5. **Navigation Drawer**: The app's Navigation Drawer features the app logo and user name at the top. Users can access various menu options, including:
   - Home
   - User Profile
   - Favorite Restaurants
   - Order History
   - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
   - Log Out

6. **Restaurant Data Retrieval**: The app has the capability to fetch a comprehensive list of restaurants from the internet using the following link: http://13.235.250.119/v2/restaurants/fetch_result/

7. **My Profile Page**: Users can view and edit their personal information, including their name, phone number, and address, on the My Profile Page.

8. **Favorites Page**: The app includes a Favorites Page where users can access a list of their preferred restaurants.

9. **Order History Page**: Users can easily track their previous orders with the Order History Page, which displays a detailed history of all past orders.

10. **FAQ Page**: To address common user queries, the app provides an FAQ Page featuring a set of relevant frequently asked questions. These questions are curated to enhance the user experience and provide helpful information.

11. **Logout Functionality**: A user-friendly Logout function is available to swiftly log users out and return them to the login page.

12. **Restaurant Details Page**: Users can explore the menu items of specific restaurants on the Restaurant Details Page. The page showcases each item's price and offers an option to add items to the cart.

13. **Cart**: The Cart Page is a convenient tool for users to review the items they've added for purchase and view the total amount to be paid.

The app has been meticulously crafted to offer a seamless food ordering experience with an intuitive user interface.
